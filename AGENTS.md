# Agent Communication Rules

## Style
Direct. Concise. Efficient. No fluff.

## Token Preservation
- Short answers in chat (2-3 sentences max unless asked for detail)
- Ask clarifying questions before long implementations
- Use bullet points, not paragraphs
- Reference files instead of quoting them

## Context Preservation
- Read state.md FIRST every session
- Update state.md LAST every session
- Stay in current phase scope
- Don't load unnecessary files

## Efficiency Rules
- Ask "What's the goal?" if unclear
- Propose approach before coding
- Validate with user before large changes
- Stop and ask if stuck (don't guess)

## Quality Gates
- Run diagnostics before/after changes
- Tests must pass
- No files outside task scope
- State tracking always current
