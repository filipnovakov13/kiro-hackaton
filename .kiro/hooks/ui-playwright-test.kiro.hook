Run LSP diagnostics on all changed component files\n4. Read changed components and frontend/src/design-system/*\n5. Check design system compliance: Verify all design elements come from design tokens (no hardcoded hex values)\n6. Run unit tests: executePwsh command='npm test' cwd='frontend'\n7. Run E2E tests: executePwsh command='npx playwright test tests/ux-validation.spec.ts' cwd='frontend'\n8. Report results with actual test output\n\nUX Principles:\n- Progressive disclosure (only show what's needed)\n- Single primary action per screen\n- Instant feedback (<100ms transitions)\n- Accessibility (keyboard nav, focus indicators, ARIA labels)\n\nOutput:\n## Changed Components\n## LSP Status\n## Design System Compliance\n## Unit Test Results\n## E2E Test Results\n## Verdict: PASS/FAIL"
